> I am definitely a big reader. I pretty much spend the vast majority of my daily sunlight inside, glued to my computer chair. Honestly, as you read this, you have no idea how much time I actually spend reading on a daily basis. For those curious cats, :smiley_cat:, your in luck! I've honestly got nothing better to do with my time, so I decided to track and catalog my daily reading material. I will warn you though, my intrests swing widely over a course of 24 hours. I will do my best to add the links as I visit them, but more often then not, I will just end up bulkcopying them into the page. 
> > **FYI** I found this really cool extension that helps me with this task, called... can you guess? TabCopy! It is an extension for Google Chrome. I think it supports Opera and Vivaldi as well. [Check it out, for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcopy/micdllihgoppmejpecmkilggmaagfdmb/related) and for [the others](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/copy-urls-from-all-open-tabs-in-browser/)
> > > The links will be in no particular order, and any notes I make will be most likely buried under a mountian of urls. But alas! Who said I would make this easy for you? If you find anything interesting, feel free to leave a comment directly on the page, visit our wiki section to take part in rancourus debate, and check out the projects section for anything I am actively working on. 
> > > > Tonight is one of those nights. It is 4:03 AM and this is what I am doing. :expressionless: Anyways, my goal here is simple. To find like minded people who might be interested in similar topics, and to display any of my creative work that results from my reading journeys. Enjoy!

**On to the meat and potatoes then!** (Or Lettuce and Tomatoes, for vegetarians)
The blog is, to the best of my ability, logically structured. This page has all of the typical homepage stuff you would expect, including (*F*) - a dynamic Table of Contents, which will update as stuff is released. (*F*) - For a birds eye view of induvidual posts, you can head over to the posts page (or folder, if your reading this on [Github](https://github.com/mtrontz-the-dev/beautiful-jekyll-starter). My goal for [future development](https://github.com/mtrontz-the-dev/beautiful-jekyll-starter/projects) is a page that lists all of the categories and tags available to filter the posts by. Lets see if I can keep this up for that long!
> P.S. Anything that is prepended with (*F*)- means that it is a feature that does not yet exist, but a work in progress. I will soon (*F*!)- have a variety of bold letters to indicate the status of various features, but for now, this is what we got. (*F*)

## Table of contents
1. (*F*) - Daily Digest
> A summary (or blob) of things I read today. Start here if you are trying to learn things that I learn.
2. (*F*) - Recent Posts
> As soon as I have enough posts to consider any of them recent, I will start to republish them as a feature on the home page. Followers can request a featured post, and it does not have to be written by me (as long as it is good).
3. I have no idea! :grimacing:
> What do people usually have on a blog, besides posts?
4. (*F*) - Ok I got it! 
> As I develop cool stuff from everything I learn, maybe I will bootstrap a few guides and tutorials.

This template was not made *entirely* from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from whom I've taken several ideas initially.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
