## Enter the world of quantum with new Microsoft Garage project, [Reference Guide for Quantum Computing](https://github.com/microsoft/Reference-Guide-For-Quantum-Computing-A-Microsoft-Garage-Project)

Microsoft Garage, in association with a few of the greatest minds of the Microsoft ecosystem, presents a 
Reference Guide for Quantum Computing, a book that can be a catalyst in your journey of learning Quantum Computing. 
It will take you on an intellectual adventure from understanding what a qubit is, how to manipulate its value, to building quantum algorithms. 
It will also provide an overview of quantum hardware technologies that are being developed.
